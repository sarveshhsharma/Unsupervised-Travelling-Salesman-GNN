# Unsupervised-Travelling-Salesman-GNN
Implements a GCN-based GNN model to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem.

## How to use the model
- Trained the GCN-based model on Travelling Salesman Problem instances, optimizing it to effectively capture multi-scale graph features.
- Saved the trained model parameters in the saved_model folder to enable efficient reuse and deployment.
- Implemented a data loading and inference pipeline using load_data to generate solutions for new TSP instances with the pretrained model.
